### How It Works

   - When user first access to this GenAI Assistant application, they required to create login using valid email address.
   - Amazon Cognito create and manage user profiles.
   - User interact with application (GenAI Assistant) for chat assistance and/or summarization of web documents, PDFs etc. 
   - At start a user submit messages using front-end application. These user messages can optionally include PDF files.
   - User have choice to select Amazon Bedrock Model - **Amazon Nova Micro** or **Anthropic Claude**. By default, this application uses Amazon Nova Micro model.
   - User messages are sent to Amazon Lambda function via Amazon API Gateway.
   - Amazon Lambda does the backend processing of user input. It analyze the user query and accordingly pull chat history from Amazon DynamoDB table.
   - A LLM chain is created with user chat history and new message. This LLM chain is then submitted to Amazon Bedrock for response generation.
   - Response from Amazon Bedrock is sent back to user and new history is created including the response generated by LLM. 
   - A chat history is maintained per user. Users have option to select their chat histories and delete any of them.



### Cost 

_You are responsible for the cost of the AWS services used while running this Guidance. We recommend creating a [Budget](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html) through [AWS Cost Explorer](https://aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/aws-cost-explorer/) to help manage costs. Prices are subject to change. For full details, refer to the pricing webpage for each AWS service used in this Guidance._

### Pricing 

Usage scenario:

   - 10 users
   - Each user uses 10,000 tokens per day
   - Here is  monthly cost breakdown for 30 days of usage


| AWS Service | Assumptions| 	Calculation| 	Estimated Monthly Cost (USD)| 
| -----------| -----------| --------------| -------------------------------| 
| Amazon Bedrock (AI)| 	10 users × 10,000 input tokens/day, equal output tokens| 	Input: (3,000,000 ÷ 1,000) × 0.003 = 9.00 Output: (3,000,000 ÷ 1,000) × 0.015 = 45.00| 	9.00 + 45.00 = 54.00| 
| AWS Amplify| 	5 GB data storage, 10 GB data transfer out per month| 	Storage: 5 × 0.023 = 0.115  Data transfer:|  10 × 0.15 = 1.50| 	0.115 + 1.50 = 1.62| 
| Amazon Cognito| 	10 monthly active users (free tier)| 	Free tier for MAUs up to 10,000| 	0.00| 
| API Gateway| 	10 users × 1,000 API requests/day	| (300,000 ÷ 1,000,000) × 3.50 = 1.05| 	1.05| 
| Lambda| 	300,000 requests/month, no GB-second cost included| 	(300,000 ÷ 1,000,000) × 0.20 = 0.06| 	0.06| 
| DynamoDB| 	5 GB storage (within free tier), 1M writes, 2M reads| 	Writes: 1 × 0.625 = 0.625 Reads: 2 × 0.125 = 0.25	| 0.625 + 0.25 = 0.88| 
| Total Estimated Cost| 		54.00 + 1.62 + 0.00 + 1.05 + 0.06 + 0.88| 	57.61|

## Deployment Steps


1. You have option to host front-end of this solution locally or on [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/). [AWS Amplify Hosting](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/hosting/) enables a fully-managed deployment of the application's React frontend in an AWS-managed account using Amazon S3 and [Amazon CloudFront](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/Introduction.html).  You can choose this option during Amazon CloudFormation stack deployment.


    **Follow below two steps only to set up Amplify Hosting:**

    -   Fork this GitHub repository and take note of your repository URL, refer (https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
    -   Create a GitHub fine-grained access token for the new repository by following [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/setting-up-GitHub-access.html). Refer section **Generate a personal access token in your GitHub account**.


2. Download Amazon [Lambda function](src/assets/genai-assistant-lambda-function.zip) and [Amazon Lambda dependencies](src/assets/genai-assistant-backend_layer.zip) and upload to your Amazon S3 bucket in same AWS Region where you will deploy this solution.
3. Download AWS CloudFormation template [guidance-for-genai-assistant.yaml](guidance-for-genai-assistant.yaml) from the GitHub repository to your local system. Update your Amazon S3 bucket name for Amazon Lambda function code and Lambda Layer.

   ```json
   S3Bucket: <YOUR AMAZON S3 BUCKET NAME> 
   ```

4. Deploy updated CloudFormation template to deploy the solution.

### Running locally

1. Clone this repository to your local machine where you will run the solution:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/guidance-for-genai-assistant.git
```

2. Navigate to the solution directory

```bash
cd guidance-for-genai-assistant
```

3. Create a file named `.env`. [Vite will use this file](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode.html) to set up environment variables when we run the application locally.

Copy the following file content and replace the values with the outputs provided in AWS CloudFormation deployment:

```plaintext
VITE_IDENTITY_POOL_ID="us-east-1:xxxx"
VITE_AWS_REGION="us-east-1"
VITE_USER_POOL_ID="us-east-1_xxxx"
VITE_USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID="xxxxxx"
VITE_API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT="https://xxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/dev"
```

4. Next, install the dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
npm ci
```

5. Finally, to start the application locally, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Vite will now start the application under `http://localhost:8080`. You can modify the port by updating [Vite configuration file](vite.config.js).



## Next Steps

In this guide we are using Amazon Bedrock with foundational models _Amazon Nova Micro_ and _Anthropic Claude 3.5 Sonnet_. You can build on top of this solution and make it more customized for your requirements. Also try [other models available on Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/models-supported.html) and review [AWS solution library](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/) for more focused solutions.


## Cleanup

When no longer needed, you can delete the resources manually or by deleting the entire AWS CloudFormation stack.

- If you want to delete the entire stack using the CloudFormation console:
    - Sign in to the AWS CloudFormation console
    - Select the Stack GenAI-Assistant and click on delete.

- Delete Amazon Lambda files uploaded on your Amazon S3 bucket.
